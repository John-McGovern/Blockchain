# Overview
A blockchain application that has an attached web app. The project uses web python3 with flask and wtforms as well as html5 and css3.

## Purpose
The purpose of building this web app was to cement my learning of python as well as gain more experience of flask, html and css.

## Functionality  
The functionality of the app includes:
* Creating a new blockchain network, that incorporates hashing, data validation and linked list data storage.
* Adding new block to the chain using a web app.
* Displaying the current chain on a web app
* Searching through the chain to see a users transactions, again displayed on a web app
* A user being able to download a copy of the chain from a personalised web page - as a way of mirroring a blockchains distributed nature
